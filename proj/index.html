                    <p>
                        The year was 2070. Earth's resources were dwindling at an alarming
                        rate, and its fate hung in the balance. Astrophysicist Dr. Adriana
                        Jensen and Geologist Dr. James Martin embarked on a mission aboard
                        the spaceship Vega-12. Their objective was to find a new source of
                        resources within the solar system that could sustain humanity. As
                        they reached the farthest corners of the solar system, Adriana and
                        James received a critical transmission from Earth. Two potential
                        celestial bodies had been identified as sources of resources: a
                        large asteroid in the Kuiper Belt and a remote moon orbiting
                        Neptune. The duo had to determine which location to investigate
                        and collect samples from, as they had limited fuel for their
                        return journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adriana looked up from her workstation, her eyes filled with
                        determination. "James, this decision could shape the future of our
                        planet. It's up to us." James nodded, understanding the gravity of
                        the situation. "Let's not forget what we've learned. We have to
                        approach this decision methodically or things could go wrong
                        quick" To evaluate the two celestial bodies, they began analyzing
                        potential risks and mapping out possible outcomes. Adriana
                        employed her knowledge of decision analysis to weigh the pros and
                        cons of each option, while James used his geological expertise to
                        determine the value of the resources they might find. They worked
                        together, trying their hardest to avoid any possible bias, and
                        ensure a quality list of choices to select from.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As they delved deeper into their research, James said, "The
                        asteroid in the Kuiper Belt appears to be a rich source of
                        resources, but its distance and unstable trajectory could
                        compromise our mission." Adriana responded, "On the other hand,
                        the moon orbiting Neptune seems to have the necessary resources,
                        but extracting them might pose significant challenges." They
                        continued their analysis, gathering information from all available
                        sources, carefully mapping out decision branches to explore
                        potential outcomes. Through their in-depth analysis, they
                        discovered that the asteroid was previously part of a larger
                        celestial body that had shattered due to a cataclysmic event. This
                        meant the asteroid held a wealth of valuable resources, but it
                        also introduced a new factor into their decision: the potential
                        for danger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As they weighed the risks against the rewards, Adriana finally
                        said, "Considering all the factors, the asteroid is our best
                        option. Even with the risks involved, the potential gain far
                        outweighs the challenges." With their course set, Adriana and
                        James prepared for the journey ahead. Upon reaching the asteroid,
                        they began the painstaking process of extracting the resources.
                        They worked in tandem, relying on each other's expertise, and
                        using their knowledge to overcome obstacles. As they loaded the
                        last batch of resources onto Vega-12, they received a distress
                        signal from another spaceship. This other ship had been on a
                        secret mission to the moon orbiting Neptune but had encountered a
                        powerful gravitational anomaly, threatening to tear their vessel
                        apart. The other crew desperately needed help, and only Vega-12
                        was close enough to attempt a rescue. Adriana and James now faced
                        another critical decision. They could continue their mission and
                        help secure Earth's future with the resources they had collected,
                        or they could risk their mission to save the lives of the other
                        very important crew members. As they debated, it became clear that
                        reaching the endangered spaceship would use up a sizeable amount
                        of their remaining fuel, leaving them with less crucial fuel
                        needed for returning to Earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After careful deliberation, they chose to attempt the rescue,
                        putting their own lives and possibly the future of Earth at risk.
                        They knew that while the resources they had collected were
                        important, the knowledge and experience of the other crew could
                        prove invaluable in the long run. They reached the stranded ship
                        in time, saving the crew and gathering even more information about
                        the moon orbiting Neptune. The two crews joined forces and,
                        against all odds, managed to devise a plan to return to Earth
                        together. They combined their fuel reserves and engineering
                        expertise to create a makeshift propulsion system. As they made
                        their journey back, they shared the information gathered during
                        their separate missions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon returning to Earth, their combined knowledge not only brought
                        new resources to humanity but also introduced innovative ways to
                        minimize the environmental impact of resource extraction. Their
                        collaboration and their willingness to take risks for one another
                        had resulted in new scientific breakthroughs and hope for Earth's
                        future. The success of their mission could be traced back to the
                        methodical decision-making process Adriana and James employed in
                        their initial choice between the asteroid and the moon. Though the
                        stakes were high and the outcomes uncertain, they relied on
                        science and rationality to guide their actions. Ultimately, it was
                        their understanding of decision-making as a science that enabled
                        them to make informed choices, leading to a brighter future for
                        all of humanity.

                    <h4>Decision Analysis</h4>is illustrated in the story
                    through the characters' methodical approach to problem-solving.
                    Adriana and James weighed the pros and cons of different options
                    and evaluated their potential outcomes based on the information
                    available to them. By examining the value of each choice, they
                    were able to make informed decisions, such as their initial choice
                    between the asteroid and the moon, and their later decision to
                    collaborate on their return journey. Decision analysis emphasizes the importance of systematic and
                    rational
                    evaluation of choices, leading to higher-quality decisions in
                    a variety of situations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h4>Fermi questions</h4> played a role in the story as the characters faced
                    uncertainties and had to estimate unknown quantities to inform
                    their decisions. For example, when calculating the remaining
                    resources, fuel, and time needed to complete their mission and
                    return to Earth, Adriana and James needed to make educated guesses
                    based on limited information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h4>Error blindness</h4>is another relevant concept,
                    particularly when Adriana and James faced unexpected challenges.
                    Despite their careful planning, they encountered unforeseen
                    obstacles and were forced to adjust their approach. Due to various factors, such as emotions,
                    cognitive biases, and external pressures, the decisons they made were altered. However, by
                    recognizing
                    and learning from their errors, they could adapt and ultimately
                    succeed in their mission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h4>Decision Trees</h4>were employed by the characters as they
                    navigated through the various stages of their mission. Decision
                    trees help visualize the branching possibilities of different
                    choices and their potential consequences. Adriana and James used
                    this concept to systematically work through the different scenarios
                    they encountered, from their initial decision between the asteroid
                    and the moon to their collaborative plan to return to Earth. By
                    considering the potential outcomes of each choice, they were better
                    equipped to make informed decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h4>Research Information</h4> The articles further discuss the role of mindfulness in
                    decision-making and how it can lead to
                    better choices. This was incorporated into the story through the characters' awareness of their
                    own thought processes and emotions, as well as their attempts to stay present and focused during
                    critical moments. By doing so, they were able to make more rational and objective decisions,
                    despite the stressful and uncertain circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the neuroscience article, the prefrontal cortex's role in decision-making was highlighted.
                        This concept was reflected in the story through Adriana and James' logical thought processes as
                        they made crucial decisions. As they encountered different situations, the characters employed
                        the various functions of their prefrontal cortex, demonstrating how this brain region plays a
                        vital role in evaluating and making informed choices in the face of uncertainty and potential
                        risks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The article on the art of making decisions presented valuable tips for decision-making. Some of
                        these strategies were demonstrated in the story, such as sorting out means and ends, weighing
                        wants and values, and overcoming worst-case-scenario thinking. By incorporating these
                        techniques, Adriana and James were better equipped to make rational decisions, further
                        showcasing the importance of methodical and strategic thinking in the decision-making process.
                    </p>
                    <p>I believe it's evident that decision-making is, in fact, a science. The characters' actions
                        show how understanding the underlying theories, psychological factors, and neurological
                        processes can lead to better decision-making in challenging circumstances, ultimately
                        highlighting the significance of the science behind the choices we make.</p>
